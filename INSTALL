Installing from source
======================

Before install, you need to install [cmake][]. Cmake installation instruction
could be found here: <http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/install.html>.

Make sure cmake is in your PATH environment variable. Switch to the root
directory of editorconfig and execute the following command:

    cmake .

If successful, the project file will be generated. On UNIX/Linux with gcc, the
project file is often a Makefile, in which case you can type "make" to compile
editorconfig.  If you are using a different compiler or platform the
compilation command may differ. For example, if you generate a NMake Makefile
and you want to use Microsoft Visual C++ to build editorconfig, then the build
command would be "nmake".

After the compilation succeeds, use the following command to install (require
root or admin privilege):

    make install

This command will copy all the file you need to corresponding directories:
editorconfig libraries will be copied to PREFIX/lib and executables will be
copied to PREFIX/bin.

Note that you have to use ldconfig or change LD_LIBRARY_PATH to specify the
PREFIX/lib as one of the library searching directory on UNIX/Linux to make sure
that source files could be linked to the libraries and executables depending on
these libraries could be executed properly.


Installing from a binary package
================================

Binary packages are not available currently. But don't worry, they will be
available soon.
