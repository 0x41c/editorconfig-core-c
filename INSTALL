1. Install from source

Before install, you need to install cmake <http://www.cmake.org>. Cmake
installation instruction could be found here
<http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/install.html>.

Make sure cmake is in your PATH environment varible. Switch to the root
directory of editorconfig and execute the following command:

CLI-prompt> cmake .

The 'CLI-prompt>' could be a '$' on bash or '%' on a C Shell, or something like
'C:\>' on Windows.

If succeeded, the project file will be generated. On UNIX/Linux, this is often a
Makefile, then you could type "make" to compile editorconfig. But if you are
using some other compilers, then compilation command would differ. For example,
if you generate a NMake Makefile and you want to use Microsoft Visual C++ to
build editorconfig, then build command would be "nmake".

After the compilation succeeds, use the following command to install (require
root or admin privilege):

CLI-prompt> make install

This command will copy all the file you need to appropriate directories.


2. Install from a binary package

Binary packages are not available currently. But don't worry, they will be
available soon.
